# The Meaning of Life

## Introduction

In this paper we shall discuss the meaning of life, or rather, the lack of
thereof.


## Methodology & Results

Let \\(\lambda\\) be the meaning of life, then clearly:

\\[ \lambda = 42 \\]

This is, of course, meaningless nonsense.


## Conclusion

As described above, the answer to the meaning of life is itself meaningless. We
can therefore safely conclude that life has no meaning. That is to say,
whatever purpose an individual decides to dedicate their life to is entirely up
to said individual.
